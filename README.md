Chada Tech Junior Developer Interview Project
Project Summary
This repository showcases my completion of the coding skills test for the Chada Tech junior developer position. The objective was to create dual clocks – a 12-hour and a 24-hour clock – to adhere to the ISO 8601 international standard for their website.

Achievement
I successfully implemented the dual clock functionality using secure and efficient C++ code.

Challenges
Throughout the project, I overcame challenges related to synchronizing the two clocks and ensuring accurate time display for both formats.

Transferable Skills
This project served as an opportunity to enhance my C++ programming skills, improve problem-solving abilities, and refine my attention to detail.

Maintainability
The code I developed is designed with maintainability, readability, and adaptability in mind, making it a strong foundation for potential future enhancements.

GitHub Submission
The completed project has been submitted to this GitHub repository as part of my application for the Chada Tech junior developer role. The repository contains the following files:

clock.cpp
clock.h
main.cpp
menu.cpp
